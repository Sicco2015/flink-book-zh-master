# Flink Tutorials

[English](https://github.com/luweizheng/flink-tutorials/blob/master/README.md) | [中文](https://github.com/luweizheng/flink-tutorials/blob/master/README_zh.md)

## Introduction

This is a tutorial repo based on Flink v1.12.4. You can clone it and learn some basic ideas about Flink. I use Java and Scala to demonstrate how to use Flink. You need to install Intellij Idea and Maven in your local environment.

**Please star this repo** if you find it useful.

I also wrote a book (in Chinese) about Flink.
